          <h2>Section 1: Introduction and Commitment to Privacy</h2>
          <p>Welcome to Drehill Private Limited. This Privacy Policy outlines our commitment to protecting the privacy of individuals who interact with our services and visit our website. It details how we collect, use, share, and protect your digital personal data.<br/>
          This policy applies to the website drehill.in and all services offered by Drehill Private Limited, a private limited company incorporated in India with Corporate Identification Number (CIN) U62099MH2023PTC415659. Our services encompass Artificial Intelligence (AI), ServiceNow Consulting, Software Consulting, Export-Import (EXIM) Consulting, and Enterprise Automation.<br/>
          It is important to clarify that this policy pertains exclusively to the corporate entity Drehill Private Limited. Initial research has shown the potential for confusion with other entities or individuals with similar names, such as the artist and author Dre Hill. This document governs only the data processing activities of the aforementioned IT company. This proactive clarification is a cornerstone of our commitment to transparency, ensuring that when you provide your data to drehill.in, you have no ambiguity about which entity is the recipient and steward of your information.<br/>
          Drehill Private Limited is steadfast in its commitment to processing digital personal data in full compliance with India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (hereinafter "DPDPA"). The DPDPA governs the processing of digital personal data within India and also applies to the processing of personal data outside India if it is for the purpose of offering goods or services to individuals within India. Recognizing the global nature of the technology industry and our clientele, our practices are also informed by leading international data protection standards, such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), to ensure a robust, forward-looking, and trustworthy privacy framework.<br/>
          This policy is designed to be a comprehensive and transparent guide to our data privacy practices. We encourage you to read it carefully to understand your rights and our obligations.</p>

          <h2>Section 2: Key Definitions</h2>
          <p>To ensure this policy is clear and easy to understand, as mandated by the DPDPA, this section defines the key terms used throughout this document. These definitions are based on the legal text of the DPDPA.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Personal Data:</b> This refers to any data about an individual who is identifiable by or in relation to such data. This is a broad definition and includes, but is not limited to, information such as your name, email address, phone number, postal address, IP address, financial information, and online identifiers. Unlike some other global regulations, the DPDPA does not create a formal distinction between 'personal data' and 'sensitive personal data' in its core obligations. Therefore, we apply robust protection standards to all personal data we process, with safeguards proportionate to the level of risk and sensitivity.</li>
            <li><b>Data Principal:</b> This is the individual to whom the personal data relates. In the context of this policy, this refers to youâ€”our website visitor, client, or any other individual whose data we process.</li>
            <li><b>Data Fiduciary:</b> This is the entity that, either alone or in conjunction with others, determines the purpose and means of processing personal data. In the context of our website and our direct business operations (like marketing or recruitment), Drehill Private Limited acts as the Data Fiduciary.</li>
            <li><b>Data Processor:</b> This is any person or entity who processes personal data on behalf of a Data Fiduciary. When we provide our core technology services to our clients, we often act as a Data Processor, handling data under their instruction.</li>
            <li><b>Processing:</b> This term covers a wide range of operations performed on digital personal data. It includes the collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure, or destruction of data.</li>
            <li><b>Consent:</b> This means any free, specific, informed, unconditional, and unambiguous indication of the Data Principal's wishes, given by a clear affirmative action, which signifies an agreement to the processing of their personal data for a specified purpose.</li>
            <li><b>Personal Data Breach:</b> This is defined as any unauthorized processing of personal data or accidental disclosure, acquisition, sharing, use, alteration, destruction, or loss of access to personal data that compromises its confidentiality, integrity, or availability.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Section 3: Our Role in Processing Your Data: Data Fiduciary and Data Processor</h2>
          <p>For a B2B technology service provider like Drehill Private Limited, it is crucial to transparently define our role in different data processing scenarios. Our relationship with personal data varies depending on the context, and we operate in a dual capacity as both a Data Fiduciary and a Data Processor. This distinction is fundamental to understanding our responsibilities under the DPDPA and our commitments to our clients.</p>
          <h3>When We Act as a Data Fiduciary</h3>
          <p>Drehill Private Limited acts as a Data Fiduciary when we determine the purposes and means of processing personal data for our own business operations. In these situations, we are directly responsible to you, the Data Principal, for complying with all provisions of the DPDPA. This includes data collected from:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Website Visitors: When you browse drehill.in, fill out our contact forms, subscribe to our newsletters, or interact with our online content.</li>
            <li>Marketing and Sales Activities: When we collect information about potential clients or leads to market our services.</li>
            <li>Recruitment: When you apply for a job with us, we collect your personal data to evaluate your application.</li>
            <li>Employees: For the management of human resources and employment-related purposes.</li>
            <li>Client Account Management: When we process the contact and billing information of our clients' representatives to manage our contractual relationship.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>When We Act as a Data Processor</h3>
          <p>Drehill Private Limited acts as a Data Processor when we process personal data on behalf of and under the instruction of our clients. In these engagements, our client is the Data Fiduciary. They determine the purpose and means of processing, and we handle the data according to their lawful instructions. This is the primary model for our core service offerings:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>AI, ServiceNow Consulting, Software Consulting, EXIM Consulting, and Enterprise Automation.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>When acting as a Data Processor, our obligations are governed by a legally binding Data Processing Agreement (DPA) executed with each client (the Data Fiduciary). This DPA ensures that we only process data under a valid contract and for the specific purposes defined by our client. The DPDPA places primary responsibility on the Data Fiduciary, but as a Data Processor, we are legally bound to assist them in their compliance and to implement robust security safeguards. This public-facing Privacy Policy does not govern the data we process on behalf of our clients; that is the exclusive domain of our client-specific DPAs. This clear separation of roles is a hallmark of a mature privacy program and assures our enterprise clients that we understand and respect the legal distinctions critical to their own compliance.</p>

          <h2>Section 4: The Personal Data We Collect</h2>
          <p>As a Data Fiduciary, Drehill Private Limited adheres to the principle of data minimization, collecting only the personal data that is necessary for the specified purpose. This section provides a transparent overview of the categories of personal data we collect directly from you or automatically through your interaction with our website.</p>
          <h3>Information You Provide Directly</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Contact and Professional Information: When you fill out a contact form, request a demo, or subscribe to our communications, we collect information such as your full name, email address, phone number, job title, and the name of your organization.</li>
            <li>Job Application Information: If you apply for a position at Drehill, we collect the information you provide in your application, including your resume or curriculum vitae (CV), cover letter, employment history, educational background, and any other data you choose to share.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Information We Collect Automatically</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Device and Usage Information: When you visit drehill.in, our servers automatically log certain information. This includes your Internet Protocol (IP) address, browser type and version, operating system, the pages you visit on our site, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, and the referring website address. This data is collected through server logs and the use of cookies.</li>
            <li>Analytics Data: We use third-party analytics services, such as Google Analytics, to help us understand website traffic and usage patterns. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, including your IP address or cookies. The data we receive from these services is typically aggregated and anonymized and is used to improve our website and services.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To provide maximum transparency and demonstrate our accountability, the following table details our primary data processing activities as a Data Fiduciary, linking the data collected to its purpose, legal basis, and retention period. This creates a clear, auditable record of our processing activities, directly addressing the DPDPA's requirement to describe the purpose of processing in the notice provided to Data Principals.</p>

          <h2>Section 5: Purpose and Lawful Basis for Processing Your Data</h2>
          <p>Drehill Private Limited is committed to processing your personal data lawfully, fairly, and transparently. We will only collect and process your data for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes, and we will not process it in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes. Under the DPDPA, all processing must have a lawful basis.</p>
          <h3>Lawful Bases for Processing</h3>
          <p>Our processing of your personal data as a Data Fiduciary relies on one of the following lawful bases:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Consent: For most of our data collection activities, particularly through our website (e.g., newsletter subscriptions, contact forms), we rely on your explicit consent. We will ensure that this consent is freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous, as detailed in Section 6.</li>
            <li>Performance of a Contract: When you or your organization engages our services, we process the personal data of your representatives to fulfill our contractual obligations, such as delivering services, providing support, and managing billing.</li>
            <li>Compliance with a Legal Obligation: We may be required to process your personal data to comply with applicable laws, such as tax laws, corporate laws, or in response to a lawful request from a government or judicial authority.</li>
            <li>Certain Legitimate Uses: The DPDPA allows for processing without explicit consent for certain "legitimate uses". For Drehill, the most relevant of these is processing for the purposes of employment, which allows us to process the data of job applicants to assess their suitability.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Purpose of Processing in Our Service Lines (as a Data Processor)</h3>
          <p>When we act as a Data Processor for our clients, the purpose of processing is determined by them (the Data Fiduciary). Our role is to execute these purposes securely and efficiently as per our contractual agreements.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</b> When we develop AI solutions, we may process large datasets provided by our clients. This data is used exclusively for the purposes defined in our client contract, such as training, validating, and testing AI models. We are committed to responsible AI development. A major concern in the industry is the potential for data to be used beyond its intended purpose. To address this, we contractually commit to using client data only for the agreed-upon project and employ privacy-enhancing techniques like data anonymization, pseudonymization, and differential privacy where feasible to minimize risk. This proactive stance on AI privacy ensures we build trust and deliver solutions that are not only powerful but also ethical and compliant.</li>
            <li><b>ServiceNow & Software Consulting:</b> In these engagements, we may require access to our clients' systems, applications, and the data contained within them. This access is strictly governed by our DPA with the client and is limited to what is necessary to perform our consulting, implementation, development, and support services. We operate within the established shared responsibility model, where the client maintains control over their data, and we provide the expertise to manage the platform securely.</li>
            <li><b>EXIM Consulting:</b> Our EXIM consulting services involve processing personal data contained within various trade documents, such as commercial invoices, packing lists, bills of lading, and customs declarations. This data can include names, addresses, and contact details of consignors, consignees, and other parties. The sole purpose of this processing is to facilitate our client's export-import transactions and ensure compliance with customs and trade regulations.</li>
            <li><b>Enterprise Automation:</b> When we implement enterprise automation solutions, we process client data as it flows through the automated workflows we design. The purpose is to streamline our client's business processes as directed by them. We embed data security and privacy controls directly into these automated workflows, ensuring that efficiency gains do not come at the cost of data protection.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Section 6: Your Consent</h2>
          <p>Consent is a cornerstone of the DPDPA and our privacy practices. When we rely on your consent as the lawful basis for processing your personal data, we are committed to ensuring that it is obtained and managed in a manner that is transparent, fair, and respects your autonomy.</p>
          <h3>The Standard for Valid Consent</h3>
          <p>In line with the DPDPA, any consent you provide to Drehill Private Limited will be:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Free: Given without coercion or undue influence.</li>
            <li>Specific: Linked to a particular, well-defined purpose of processing. We will not bundle requests for consent for multiple, unrelated purposes.</li>
            <li>Informed: You will be provided with clear and comprehensive information about the data being collected and the purpose of its processing before you give consent.</li>
            <li>Unconditional: The provision of our services will not be made conditional on your consent to the processing of personal data that is not necessary for that service.</li>
            <li>Unambiguous: Your consent must be given through a clear affirmative action, such as ticking a box, clicking a button, or another explicit gesture that signifies your agreement. We will not use pre-ticked boxes or interpret silence or inactivity as consent.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Notice Accompanying Consent Requests</h3>
          <p>Every request for your consent will be presented in clear and plain language, free from legal jargon. As required by law, we will provide you with the option to access the request in English or any other language specified in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution of India. The notice accompanying the request will clearly state:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The specific categories of personal data to be collected and processed.</li>
            <li>The explicit purpose(s) for which the data will be processed.</li>
            <li>The manner in which you can exercise your rights, including the right to withdraw consent.</li>
            <li>The contact details for our Grievance Officer and the procedure for filing a complaint with the Data Protection Board of India.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Right to Withdraw Consent</h3>
          <p>You have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. We are legally obligated to ensure that the process of withdrawing consent is as easy and straightforward as the process of giving it. This is a practical commitment, not just a legal statement. If you provide consent with a single click, you will be able to withdraw it with comparable ease, for example, through a "Manage Preferences" or "Unsubscribe" link in our email communications or a dedicated section in a user portal.<br/>
          The withdrawal of your consent will not affect the lawfulness of any data processing that was carried out based on your consent before its withdrawal. Upon receiving your withdrawal request, we will cease processing your personal data for the purpose(s) to which you had consented, unless we have another lawful basis to continue (e.g., a legal obligation to retain certain records). Please note that withdrawing consent for processing that is essential for a service may result in our inability to continue providing that service to you.</p>

          <h2>Section 7: Your Rights as a Data Principal</h2>
          <p>The DPDPA empowers you with several rights over your personal data. Drehill Private Limited is committed to upholding these rights and providing you with accessible means to exercise them. As a Data Principal, you have the following rights with respect to the personal data we process as a Data Fiduciary:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Right to Access Information: You have the right to request and obtain from us a summary of the personal data we hold about you. You can also request information about our processing activities, including the purposes of processing and any third parties with whom your data has been shared.</li>
            <li>Right to Correction and Erasure:
              <ul>
                <li>Correction: You have the right to request the correction of any personal data that is inaccurate or misleading. You also have the right to have incomplete data completed.</li>
                <li>Erasure: You have the right to request the erasure (deletion) of your personal data. We will comply with this request if the data is no longer necessary for the purpose for which it was collected, or if you have withdrawn your consent for its processing (and there is no other legal ground for us to retain it).</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Right of Grievance Redressal: You have the right to a readily available and effective mechanism for grievance redressal regarding any of our acts or omissions in relation to the processing of your personal data or the exercise of your rights. The detailed process for this is provided in Section 14 of this policy.</li>
            <li>Right to Nominate: In the event of your death or incapacity, you have the right to nominate another individual who can exercise these rights on your behalf.</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>How to Exercise Your Rights</h3>
          <p>To exercise any of the rights listed above, please submit a verifiable request to us by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Emailing our Grievance Officer at: <a href="mailto:privacy@drehill.in">privacy@drehill.in</a></li>
            <li>Writing to us at our registered address: Pl No-22A Ne Mayur Park S No 187/2 Harsool, Aurangabad, Maharashtra, India, 431001.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Your request should contain sufficient information to allow us to reasonably verify that you are the person about whom we collected personal data. We will respond to your request within a reasonable time, in accordance with the timelines that may be prescribed under the DPDPA rules.<br/>
          It is important to note that the DPDPA, in its final enacted form, does not grant a "Right to Data Portability" as found in some other international regulations like the GDPR. Therefore, while you have the right to access a summary of your data, we are not legally obligated to provide it in a structured, machine-readable format for transfer to another service provider. This policy accurately reflects the rights granted under current Indian law.</p>

          <h2>Section 8: Data Sharing, Disclosure, and Sub-processors</h2>
          <p>Drehill Private Limited is committed to maintaining the confidentiality of your personal data. We do not sell your personal data to third parties. This section outlines the limited circumstances under which we may share or disclose your personal data.<br/>
          We may share your personal data with the following categories of recipients:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Data Processors and Sub-processors: We engage trusted third-party service providers to perform various functions on our behalf. These entities act as our Data Processors (or "sub-processors"). This includes providers of cloud hosting, data analytics, customer relationship management (CRM) systems, communication tools, and payment processing services. We enter into legally binding contracts (Data Processing Agreements) with all our processors. These contracts obligate them to maintain the confidentiality and security of the data, to process it only on our instructions and for the specified purpose, and to comply with the same data protection obligations that we adhere to. Proactive transparency regarding our sub-processors is crucial for building client trust, as it allows our clients to conduct their own risk assessments of the entire data custody chain.</li>
            <li>Legal and Regulatory Authorities: We may be required to disclose your personal data to comply with a legal obligation, a court order, or a lawful request from government authorities, law enforcement agencies, or regulatory bodies.</li>
            <li>Professional Advisors: We may share your data with our professional advisors, such as lawyers, auditors, and accountants, to the extent necessary for them to provide their services to us, under strict confidentiality obligations.</li>
            <li>Business Transfers: In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, bankruptcy, or sale of all or a portion of our assets, your personal data may be transferred as part of the transaction. We will notify you of any such transfer and any changes to this Privacy Policy.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>To provide full transparency, the following table lists the categories of third-party sub-processors we use to deliver our services. This demonstrates our commitment to a mature vendor management program, a key component of providing "reasonable security safeguards."</p>

          <h2>Section 9: Cross-Border Data Transfers</h2>
          <p>As a global IT service provider, Drehill Private Limited may need to transfer your personal data to locations outside the territory of India. This is often necessary to engage with our international sub-processors who provide essential services, such as cloud hosting or specialized software tools, which may be located in different parts of the world.<br/>
          Our policy on cross-border data transfers is designed to be fully compliant with the DPDPA while also meeting the higher standards expected by our international clientele.<br/>
          The DPDPA permits the transfer of personal data by a Data Fiduciary to any country or territory outside India, except for those that are specifically restricted by the Central Government of India through a notification (a "negative list" approach). As of the effective date of this policy, we will comply with any such notifications issued by the Government of India.<br/>
          However, we recognize that the DPDPA's framework is more permissive than the "adequacy decision" model required by regulations like the GDPR. To ensure the trust of our global clients and to provide a uniformly high standard of data protection, Drehill voluntarily adopts a more stringent approach. For any transfer of personal data outside India, regardless of the destination country's status, we will ensure that a comparable level of data protection to that afforded under Indian law is maintained. We achieve this by implementing appropriate safeguards, which may include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) or Data Processing Agreements (DPAs): We enter into robust contractual agreements with our sub-processors that include data protection obligations consistent with the principles of the DPDPA and other leading global standards.</li>
            <li>Intra-Group Transfer Agreements: For transfers to any of our own future international affiliates, we will implement binding corporate rules or similar agreements to govern the secure flow of data.</li>
            <li>Technical and Organizational Measures: We ensure that the recipients of the data have implemented adequate security measures to protect the data against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>By adopting these enhanced safeguards, we go beyond the minimum legal requirements of the DPDPA. This approach ensures that our clients, particularly those from jurisdictions with stricter data transfer laws like the EU, can be confident that their data remains protected throughout its lifecycle, no matter where it is processed. This commitment to being a globally-compliant partner is a cornerstone of our business strategy.</p>

          <h2>Section 10: Data Security and Safeguards</h2>
          <p>Drehill Private Limited is deeply committed to protecting the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the personal data in our possession or under our control. The DPDPA mandates that every Data Fiduciary must implement "reasonable security safeguards" to prevent personal data breaches. We interpret "reasonable" to mean a comprehensive, multi-layered security program that is aligned with industry best practices and proportionate to the risks associated with the data we process.<br/>
          Our security program encompasses a range of technical and organizational measures designed to protect data throughout its lifecycle. This commitment extends not only to the data we process as a Fiduciary but also to the data we handle as a Processor on behalf of our clients.<br/>
          Our key security safeguards include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Encryption: We employ industry-standard encryption protocols to protect your data. Data is encrypted in transit using Transport Layer Security (TLS) to secure communications between your browser and our servers. Data is encrypted at rest using robust algorithms like AES-256 to protect it while stored on our servers or in our databases.</li>
            <li>Access Control: We adhere strictly to the principles of least privilege and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC). This means that our employees and systems are only granted access to the personal data that is absolutely necessary for them to perform their designated job functions. Access rights are reviewed regularly and revoked promptly upon change of role or termination of employment.</li>
            <li>Authentication: To prevent unauthorized access, we enforce strong password policies and mandate the use of Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for all internal access to critical systems and applications that process personal data.</li>
            <li>Network Security: Our network is protected by firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and other security measures to monitor and block malicious traffic and unauthorized access attempts.</li>
            <li>Vulnerability Management and Patching: We conduct regular vulnerability assessments and penetration testing to proactively identify and remediate security weaknesses in our systems and applications. We maintain a rigorous patch management process to ensure that all systems are updated with the latest security patches in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Employee Training and Awareness: We recognize that human error can be a significant risk factor. All our employees undergo mandatory and continuous training on data privacy principles, cybersecurity best practices, and their responsibilities in protecting client and company data.</li>
            <li>Incident Response Plan: Despite our best efforts, no system is entirely immune to risk. We have a documented and tested Data Breach Incident Response Plan in place. In the event of a personal data breach, this plan enables us to take immediate steps to contain the incident, assess the impact, and notify the Data Protection Board of India and affected Data Principals in accordance with the DPDPA's requirements.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>By implementing these specific, industry-standard controls, we provide a robust and defensible interpretation of "reasonable security safeguards," demonstrating that data protection is not an afterthought but is integrated by design into our operations.</p>

          <h2>Section 11: Data Retention and Erasure Policy</h2>
          <p>In line with the data protection principles of purpose limitation and storage limitation, Drehill Private Limited has established a clear policy for the retention and subsequent erasure of personal data. Our core principle is that we will not retain personal data for longer than is necessary to fulfill the specific and lawful purpose for which it was collected.</p>
          <h3>Triggers for Data Erasure</h3>
          <p>As a Data Fiduciary, we are obligated under Section 8(7) of the DPDPA to erase personal data when one of the following events occurs, whichever is earlier:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Withdrawal of Consent: When a Data Principal withdraws the consent that formed the basis for the data processing, we will erase the relevant personal data.</li>
            <li>Completion of Purpose: When it is reasonable to assume that the specified purpose for which the personal data was collected is no longer being served, the data will be erased.</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This obligation extends to any Data Processors we have engaged to handle the data on our behalf; we will ensure they also erase the data in these circumstances.</p>
          <h3>Retention Periods</h3>
          <p>The specific retention period for your personal data will vary depending on the category of data and the purpose of its collection, as detailed in the table in Section 4 of this policy. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Client Financial Records: Data related to billing and payments will be retained for the period required by Indian tax and corporate laws (typically up to 7 years after the end of the financial year).</li>
            <li>Marketing Data: Personal data collected for marketing purposes based on your consent will be retained only as long as your consent is active. Upon withdrawal of consent (e.g., unsubscribing from a newsletter), your data will be promptly removed from our marketing lists.</li>
            <li>Job Applicant Data: For unsuccessful applicants, we will retain application data for a period of one year to consider them for future opportunities, after which it will be securely deleted.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The draft Digital Personal Data Protection Rules, 2025 (draft DPDPR) have proposed specific retention periods for certain large-scale data fiduciaries. While Drehill may not currently meet these thresholds, we have proactively adopted a policy of establishing clear, purpose-based retention schedules for all data categories as a matter of best practice. We utilize automated systems where feasible to help enforce these retention policies, reducing the risk of human error and ensuring that data is not held indefinitely.</p>
          <h3>Method of Erasure</h3>
          <p>Once the retention period for personal data has expired, we will ensure its secure and permanent disposal. Digital data will be erased using methods that prevent its recovery. Any physical documents containing personal data will be securely shredded before disposal.</p>

          <h2>Section 12: Children's Data</h2>
          <p>Drehill Private Limited's services and website are intended for a professional, business-to-business audience and are not directed at, nor intended for use by, individuals under the age of 18, who are defined as "children" under the DPDPA.<br/>
          We do not knowingly collect, use, or process personal data from children. The DPDPA imposes very strict obligations on any entity processing the data of a child, including the requirement to obtain verifiable consent from a parent or legal guardian, and prohibits activities such as tracking, behavioral monitoring, or targeted advertising directed at children.<br/>
          If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected personal data from a child without the requisite verifiable parental consent, we will take immediate steps to delete that information from our systems. If you are a parent or guardian and you believe that your child has provided us with personal data without your consent, please contact our Grievance Officer immediately at privacy@drehill.in so that we can take appropriate action.<br/>
          Having this clear, prohibitive statement in our policy is a crucial compliance safeguard, even though processing children's data is outside the scope of our normal business operations.</p>
